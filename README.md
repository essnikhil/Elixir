# Elixir
Project Description:
Elixir is an inventory database that a government/private organization can use to understand the efficient supply of medicines/drugs based on the patients, diseases, and symptoms count. This system will ensure the proper drug distribution based on the facts/information to avoid drug shortages. Shelf-life of the drugs is also considered to prevent wastage. As an act of awareness, this database is not only limited to inventory but also provides insightful information about the diseases based on the userâ€™s symptoms. It also provides insights into the number of beds available in a hospital.

This answers the real-world problems like the below:
1. How many medicines/drugs need to be sent to a particular area/city depending on the patients and their diseases?
2. Prediction of the disease based on the symptoms
3. In which hospital a patient has to be admitted, depending on the number of beds available in a hospital.
4. What hospitals have diagnostic labs and pharmacies?
