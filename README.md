MedicSupply is an inventory database that a government/private organization can use to understand the efficient supply of medicines/drugs based on the patients, diseases, and symptoms count. This system will ensure the proper drug distribution based on the facts/information to avoid drug shortages. Self-life of the drugs is also considered to prevent wastage. As an act of awareness, this database is not only limited to inventory but also provides insightful information about the diseases based on the userâ€™s symptoms.
